## Acknowledgment

This course is based on [Data 8](http://data8.org), a course taught by
Ani Adhikari and John DeNero at the University of California, Berkeley. 
They and their teaching assistants have developed many of the materials
we are using in our own course.  We are using those materials with their
permission, which we gratefully acknowledge.

We also gratefully acknowledge last year's instructors, Madeleine Udell
and Michael Clarkson, for their assistance in setting up this year's 
course.
